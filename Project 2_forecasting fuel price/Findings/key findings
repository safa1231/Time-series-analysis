🎯 1. Objective

To model and forecast the weekly retail price of Euro-Super 95 gasoline in a European market from January 2005 to August 2021, and generate a 52-week (1-year) forecast using statistically robust time series models: ARIMA, ETS, and SARIMA.

 2. Methodology

2.1 Data Preparation
  Source: Weekly fuel price dataset (2005–2021), filtered for “Euro-Super 95”.
  Frequency: Weekly (≈860 observations from 2005-01-03 to 2021-08-16).
  Variable: PRICE (EUR per barrel).

2.2 Stationarity Testing
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test on original series:
Test Statistic: -2.529
p-value: 0.354 → ❌ Not stationary (fail to reject H₀).
First Differencing applied → tseries_diff
ADF Test on Differenced Series:
Test Statistic: -8.743
p-value: < 0.01 →  Stationary SO one order of differencing is required for stationarity. 

2.3 Model Identification (based on ACF/PACF)
Plotted ACF and PACF of differenced series.
Suggested potential AR and MA terms (based on lags that hace significant spikes).
Generated candidate models: ARIMA(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,1,3).



3. Model Fitting & Selection
Three classes of models were fitted and compared:ARIMA(2,1,2),Exponential smoothhing model and SARIMA model
3.1 ARIMA Model 

Selected Model: ARIMA(2,1,2)
Coefficients:
AR1 = -0.2053, AR2 = 0.5644
MA1 = 0.6481, MA2 = -0.2687
AIC: 6495.13 → ✅ Best AIC so far
Ljung-Box Test: p = 0.178 → ✅ Residuals are white noise (no significant autocorrelation)

3.2 ETS Model (Error, Trend, Seasonality)

Selected Model: ETS(A, A, N) → Additive Error, Additive Damped Trend, No Seasonality
Smoothing Parameters:
α (level) = 0.9999 → The new observation is very responsive to the last observed value
β (trend) = 0.4575 → Moderate trend adaptation
φ (damping) = 0.8 → Trend dampens over time (reasonable for volatile fuel prices)
AIC: 9765.15 → ❌ Much higher than ARIMA → Thus less preferred statistically

3.3 SARIMA Model (Seasonal ARIMA)
We forced D=1 and bounded seasonal terms (max.P=2, max.Q=2) to rigorously test for yearly cycles in weekly fuel prices — a domain-reasonable hypothesis  while disabling stepwise search and approximation to ensure no viable seasonal model was overlooked by automation. 
Selected Model: ARIMA(2,1,2) — same as non-seasonal auto.arima
-> The algorithm found no significant seasonal pattern to justify seasonal terms (P=0, Q=0, D=0 internally, even though you forced D=1 search).

📈 4. Forecasting Results (Next 52 Weeks)
All models produced flat or very slowly changing forecasts. Here’s why:

🔍 Why Forecasts Are Flat
-ARIMA(2,1,2):
This is a stationary model after differencing.Once differenced, if no strong autoregressive momentum remains, forecasts revert to long-run mean thus, the flat line.
Coefficients suggest moderate mean-reversion (AR2 = 0.56), but not enough to sustain a trend.
-ETS(A,A,N):
Includes a damped trend (φ=0.8), so forecast shows a very gentle upward slope that flattens out .
-SARIMA:
Reduced to same ARIMA(2,1,2) → same flat forecast.

5. Recommendations 
ARIMA (2,1,2) has the lowest AIC and BIC values which reflect the goodness of fit of the models so the best model to adopt is ARIMA(2,1,2).It can serve as Baseline Model:Best statistical fit, clean residuals.
