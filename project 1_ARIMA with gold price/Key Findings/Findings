# Findings: Gold Price Analysis

## Stationarity
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test indicated that the original gold price series was non-stationary.
After applying first-order differencing, the series became stationary, making it suitable for time series modeling.
- ADF test (p-value < 0.01) → series is stationary after differencing.

## Model Selection
- Best model: ARIMA(1,1,0)  
- AIC = 20577.78, BIC = 20589.44
-> The lower their value ,the better

## Residual Diagnostics
- Ljung-Box test's p-value = 0.1396 → residuals are uncorrelated (nearly behave like white noise).

## Forecast
- Forecasts for 365 days ahead show a random-walk-like behavior with wide confidence intervals.
This reflects the high volatility and uncertainty of gold prices, highlighting the difficulty of making precise long-term predictions in such markets.
