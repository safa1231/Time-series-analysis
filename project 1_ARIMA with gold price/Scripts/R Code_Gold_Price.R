#the best model is ARIMA(1,1,0):gold price data is essentially a random walk with a very weak AR(1) component. The ARIMA(1,1,0) model fits well, passes residual checks, and provides a reasonable basis for forecasting.

#ARIMA(1,1,0) model says:
#Gold prices donâ€™t have a strong predictable trend.
#The expected price stays around the last observed level.
#However, prices could move up or down significantly, hence the widening cone.
#This outcome is not surprising asit matches what weâ€™d expect from financial series like gold: they often behave like a random walk (difficult to forecast long-term trends).
